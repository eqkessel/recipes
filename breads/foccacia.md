## Ingredients

- 2 1/2 tsp active dry yeast (1 package)
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1 cup warm water
- 4 Tbsp olive oil
- 1 tsp salt
- Coarse salt for garnish
- 2 3/4+ cups flour
- 1 Tbsp minced fresh rosemary
  - Substitute: 1/2 Tbsp dried rosemary. Soak in water and strain.
- Fresh rosemary leaves for garnish
  - Similar substitute as above.

## Steps

### Dough Preparation

1. Proof the yeast in the warm (blood-temperature) water with the sugar. Wait 5 minutes until foamy.
2. Mix the flour, salt, and minced rosemary in a bowl. Add the proofed yeast mixture and 3 Tbsp. of the olive oil.
3. Continue to add small amounts of flour until the dough forms a ball. Kneed
the dough for a minute.
4. Place the dough ball in an oiled bowl and turn to cover with oil. Cover bowl
with plastic wrap and towel and allow to rise in a warm place for 1 hour.
    - Tip: the oiled bowl prevents the dough from sticking (as much) as it
    rises.

### Baking

0. Preheat oven to 450Â°F.
1. On a floured surface, roll dough out into a 1/4 in. thick round. Transfer to
an oiled baking sheet or pizza pan.
2. Using your fingers, make small impressions in the surface of the dough about
1 in. apart. Brush the remaining olive oil on, and sprinkle with the coarse salt
and rosemary leaves garnish.
3. Allow dough to rise for an additional 20 minutes.
4. Bake for 20 minutes or until golden brown.
