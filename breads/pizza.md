**Prep time** | 1 hour 20 minutes.
**Cook time** | 15 minutes.
**Servings** | Makes 1 ~12-inch pizza.

## Ingredients

### Pizza Dough

- 2 1/2 tsp active dry yeast (1 package)
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1 cup warm water
- 3 Tbsp olive oil
- 1 tsp salt
- 2+ cups flour

### Pizza Toppings

- 2 Tbsp Marinara sauce or other tomato sauce
- 1 package pre-sliced fresh Mozzerella cheese
- Pepperoni slices

## Steps

### Dough Preparation

1. Proof the yeast in the warm (blood-temperature) water with the sugar. Wait 5 minutes until foamy.
2. Mix the flour, and salt in a bowl. Add the proofed yeast mixture and the olive oil.
3. Continue to add small amounts of flour until the dough forms a ball. Kneed
the dough for a minute.
4. Place the dough ball in an oiled bowl and turn to cover with oil. Cover bowl
with plastic wrap and towel and allow to rise in a warm place for 1 hour.
    - Tip: the oiled bowl prevents the dough from sticking (as much) as it
    rises.

### Baking

0. Preheat oven to 500째F.
    - Note: I've observed hotter is almost always better for baking pizza, as
    commerical pizza ovens run at 700+째F. Most household ovens only go up to
    500째F, so this recipe uses that temperature.
1. On a floured baking sheet or pizza pan, roll dough out into a 1/2 in. thick round, about 12-14 inches in diameter.
    - Note: This dough recipe really works best as a thick dough rather than a thin crispy dough, and tends to get soaked through when too thin
    (especially with high-moisture fresh Mozzerlla).
2. Using your fingers, make small impressions in the surface of the dough about
1 in. apart. Using a spoon, apply and spread the Marinara sauce to about 1 inch
from the edges of the dough. The layer of sauce should just barely cover the
applied area.
3. Lay slices of Mozzerella cheese on surface to cover the sauced area.
Cover cheese with a layer of pepperoni slices.
4. Bake for 15 minutes or until cheese starts browning.
    - Tip: to better facilitate the cheese browning, switching the oven from
    bake to broil (still at 500째F) for the second half of cooking.
